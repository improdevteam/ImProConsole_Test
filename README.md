# ImProConsole_Test

ImPro Console is an image measurement software for structural experiments. It
includes tools for stereo calibration, target tracking, video synchronization 
between two cameras, stereo triangulation. 

This version includes two types of camera-calibration manners that are designed 
for large-scale structural experiments. 

This version includes a synchronization method that can estimate the time 
lag (difference) between two cameras (where positive value of time lag means 
the second camera started later). 

The current version available here is designed to be available with a 
journal paper under review.
